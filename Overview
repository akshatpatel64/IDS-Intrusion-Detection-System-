The focus of my project is on the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of
detecting unauthorized traffic and potential security breaches within a network. The system utilizes Snort
rules for packet sniffing, allowing for the differentiation of IP addresses originating from outside the
organization's network. The packet traffic for the project was obtained from Charusat University's
network, with the system designed to capture and detect different types of packets, including those
originating from Google, PDF, MP3, and e-governance websites. Additionally, the system is capable of
detecting the use of FTP protocol, JPEG, GZIP, and MP3 packets.

My motivation for this project was to address the security loopholes present in the e-governance website
of Charusat University, as well as to provide a more secure and dependable solution for maintaining a
healthy internet environment. To achieve this, the IDS includes constant monitoring and restriction of
student access to vulnerable IPs, as well as the deployment of Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). The
system also includes an application that eliminates the need to monitor CMD, as it tracks and logs all data
directly to the application. The app also features a user-friendly interface and the ability to create unique
and consolidated logs of IPs accessing different packets. Overall, this project aims to improve the security
and reliability of network systems, particularly in educational institutions.
